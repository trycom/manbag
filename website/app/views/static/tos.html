        <p>10.1 After placing an order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order.&nbsp; Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted.&nbsp; Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product.&nbsp; All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email that confirms that the Product has been dispatched (the Dispatch Confirmation).&nbsp; The contract between us (the ‘Contract’) will only be formed when we send you the Shipping Confirmation.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>10.2 The Contract will relate only to those Products whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Shipping Confirmation.&nbsp; We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Shipping Confirmation.</p>

        <p>11.1 Please note that in some cases, we accept orders as agents on behalf of third party sellers.&nbsp; The resulting legal contract is between you and that third party seller, and is subject to the terms and conditions of that third party seller, which they will advise you of directly.&nbsp; You should carefully review their terms and conditions applying to the transaction.</p>
        
        <p>11.2 We may also provide links on our Site to the websites of other companies, whether affiliated with us or not.&nbsp; We cannot give any undertaking, that products you purchase from third party sellers through our Site, or from companies to whose website we have provided a link on our Site, will be of satisfactory quality, and any such warranties are DISCLAIMED by us absolutely.&nbsp; This DISCLAIMER does not affect your statutory rights against the third party seller.&nbsp; We will notify you when a third party is involved in a transaction, and we may disclose your customer information related to that transaction to the third party seller.</p>

        <p>12.1 If you are contracting as a consumer, you may cancel a Contract at any time within seven working days, beginning on the day after you received the Products.&nbsp; In this case, you will be entitled to either receive a full refund of the price paid for the Products or store credit in accordance with our <a href="/returns-policy">returns policy</a> and section 17, below.</p>
        
        <p>12.2 To cancel a Contract, you must inform us in writing. You must also return the Product(s) to us immediately, in the same condition in which you received them, and at your own cost and risk.&nbsp; You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the Products while they are in your possession. If you fail to comply with this obligation, we may have a right of action against you for compensation.&nbsp; In the event, that delivery of your Product has been dispatched but we have been unable to deliver it to you, and attempts at re-delivery of the Product have been made unsuccessfully <strong>and</strong> you have not exercised your right to cancel the Contract, we shall treat your lack of communication as a rejection of the Product and an implied cancellation of the Contract and we will refund you the purchase price in accordance with your rights under our Refund Policy.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>12.3 You will not have any right to cancel a Contract for the supply of Custom Made Goods.</p>
        
        <p>12.4 Details of this statutory right, and an explanation of how to exercise it, are provided in the Dispatch Confirmation.&nbsp; This provision does not affect your statutory rights.</p>

        <p>15.4 Our Site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our Site may be incorrectly priced.&nbsp; We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you.&nbsp; If a Product’s correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.</p>
        
        <p>15.5 We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you a Shipping Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mis-pricing.</p>
        
        <p>15.6 Payment for all Products must be by credit or debit card. We accept payment with the following Credit and Debit Cards:</p>
