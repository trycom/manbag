                <li>We do a discovery call with every customer to discuss their requirements, sizes, likes and dislikes in detail. It's actually more expensive for us to send you stuff you won't like and you return it, so we try and get it right first time.</li>
                <li>In the rare scenario that you'd like to return something, it's easy to get a refund or an exchange in your next package. <a href="/returns">Click here</a> for info on how to return something.</li>

           <li>Reward points is money you've earned from our loyalty programme, and is convertible to cash. Store credit is a refund that you've stored in your account as credit towards your next purchase.</li>
